# Review UI Web Application
This web application allows a user to add, delete, and edit reviews.  The app also displays
the average rating of the all reviews and total amount of reviews. The user is also about to navigate to an
About page where the user can read about how the application works.

# Learning Outcomes

I learned how to use framer-motion which allows for animations to be used on components. Furthermore,
I got a better understanding of position relative vs absolute and how it can make my future project better.

# Challenges 

The challenge was keeping track of a lot components I believe I could have minimized the amount of components made.
